# Crossplane ProviderK8sExample

Sample Crossplane Composition using Provider-Kubernetes to propagate K8s Secrets form Crossplane cluster to remote provisioned cluster.

This pair of Compositions require other Compositions that deploy EKS cluster and configure provider-kubernetes in the Crossplane cluster. See the platform reference AWS in Upbound MarketPlace for an example of that.
